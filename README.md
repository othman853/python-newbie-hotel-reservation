# hotel-reservation.py

A newbie attempt of solving Hotel Reservation problem in Python. 

Exclusively for learning purposes.

For now, trying to get familiar with Python syntax, writing simple, procedural code on `godfile.py` no patterns nor good practices, just some messy code. 

Furthermore: 
  - Apply minimal OO
  - Separate concerns
  - Evolve on cleaner code and refactoring
  - Explore Python resources and structure
  - Unit tests
